# SeekerClaw — Project Description

> **Living document.** Update after every shipped feature. Read before any feature work.

## One-Liner

SeekerClaw turns a Solana Seeker phone into a 24/7 personal AI agent you control through Telegram.

## Elevator Pitch

SeekerClaw embeds a full Node.js runtime inside an Android app, running an OpenClaw-compatible AI gateway as a foreground service. Users interact with their agent through Telegram — the app itself is minimal (setup, status, logs, settings). The agent has 56 tools, 35 skills (20 bundled + 13 workspace + 2 user-created), ranked memory search, cron scheduling, Android device control, Solana wallet integration, and web intelligence — all running locally on the phone, 24/7.

## What It Is

SeekerClaw is an Android app built for the Solana Seeker phone (also works on any Android 14+ device with 4GB+ RAM). It packages a Node.js 18 runtime via nodejs-mobile and runs an AI agent gateway derived from OpenClaw. The agent connects to Anthropic's Claude API for intelligence and to Telegram for user communication.

**Who it's for:** Seeker phone owners who want an always-on AI assistant that can manage their crypto wallet, control their phone, search the web, and automate tasks — all from Telegram.

**How it works:**
1. User installs the app, scans a QR code with API credentials
2. The app starts a foreground service running Node.js
3. Node.js runs the AI gateway, connecting to Claude + Telegram
4. User sends messages in Telegram, agent responds with tools

## Features — Shipped

### AI Agent Core
- **Claude integration** — Opus 4.6 (default), Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5 selectable. Prompt caching, retry with backoff, rate-limit throttling, user-friendly error messages. OAuth/setup token support for Claude Pro/Max users. Conversational API key setup flow.
- **Multi-provider architecture** — Provider adapter pattern (claude/openai/openrouter) with unified internal message format. OpenAI Responses API support (`/v1/responses`) with SSE streaming, function_call items, vision. OpenRouter Chat Completions adapter with prompt caching, model fallbacks, error classification (401-503), vision support. Provider-agnostic DB logging and usage tracking. Safe defaults — unknown provider falls back to Claude. Credential hygiene — only active provider's key written to config.json.
- **Multi-turn task execution** — Reliable P2 multi-turn: tool budget management with validation-aware restore, silent turn stop prevention on budget exhaustion, MAX_TOOL_USES=25 for complex tasks
- **API timeout hardening** — Configurable timeouts (replacing hardcoded 60s), bounded retry with backoff for timeout paths, turn-level tracing instrumentation, sanitized user-visible error messages, 429 retry jitter
- **Context token estimation + adaptive trimming** — Token-aware conversation management that estimates context size and trims oldest messages to stay within limits, preventing API failures from oversized contexts
- **Streaming + payload optimization** — Eliminates API transport timeouts via streaming responses, response field whitelisting to prevent payload bloat (_inputJson leak fix), MAX_HISTORY bumped 20→35 for richer context
- **Telegram owner gate** — Service refuses to start without valid TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID; unauthorized users get reaction + comment warning; all gate events logged at WARN level
- **MCP support** — Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers via Streamable HTTP. Users add server URLs in Settings; agent discovers and uses tools at startup. Description sanitization, SHA-256 rug-pull detection, untrusted content wrapping, per-server + global rate limiting.
- **Telegram bot** — HTML formatting (no markdown headers), native blockquotes, bidirectional reactions, file download with vision, file upload (telegram_send_file tool), long message chunking, quoted replies via `[[reply_to_current]]`, emoji rendering fixed, companion-tone message templates (docs/internal/TEMPLATES.md), context-aware `/start`, sent message ID tracking (ring buffer, 24h TTL) + `telegram_send` tool for same-turn delete flows, contextual status messages for long-running tools (🔍 Searching..., ⚙️ Running..., etc.), inline keyboard buttons via `telegram_send` with callback query handling
- **SILENT_REPLY protocol** — Agent silently drops messages when it has nothing useful to say
- **Ephemeral session awareness** — Agent knows context resets on restart
- **PLATFORM.md auto-generation** — Device state (model, RAM, storage, battery, permissions, wallet) written on every service start
- **Self-awareness system prompt** — Self-knowledge doors, architecture blocks, self-diagnosis playbook for troubleshooting tool failures and silent responses. Debug log rotation at 5MB with `.old` archive. DIAGNOSTICS.md deep troubleshooting guide. SAB-AUDIT-v13: 100% score (141/141 audit points)
- **Structured log levels** — DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR pipeline with per-level routing; UI log viewer color-coded by level; LogCollector filters noise from debug output
- **Skill routing** — Routing blocks prevent conflicting skills from firing together; reply tag first-token rule for reliable `[[reply_to_current]]` detection
- **Skill requirements gating** — Skills with `requires.bins` or `requires.env` in YAML frontmatter are checked at runtime; unmet requirements are reported and skill is skipped

### Memory System
- **SOUL.md** — Agent personality (user-editable)
- **IDENTITY.md / USER.md** — Agent and owner profiles (created during bootstrap)
- **MEMORY.md** — Long-term memory via `memory_save` tool
- **Daily notes** — `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files via `daily_note` tool
- **SQL.js memory search** — Files indexed into chunks with TF + recency ranked search
- **HEARTBEAT.md** — Real agent probe heartbeat with configurable interval (not overwritten by app)
- **Auto session summaries** — Generated on idle (10min), message checkpoints (50), `/new`, and shutdown

### Scheduling (Cron)
- **One-shot reminders** — "in 30 minutes", "tomorrow at 9am"
- **Recurring jobs** — "every 2 hours", "every day at noon"
- **Natural language parsing** — No cron syntax needed
- **JSON persistence** — Atomic writes with backup, per-job execution history
- **Zombie detection** — 2-hour threshold with error backoff

### Web Intelligence
- **Web search** — Brave Search (default) + DuckDuckGo Lite (zero-config fallback) + Perplexity Sonar (AI-synthesized answers)
- **Web fetch** — HTML-to-markdown, JSON, caching, redirects, custom headers/methods/bodies

### Skills (20 bundled + 13 workspace, version-aware seeding)
**Bundled skills (OpenClaw format, seeded by ConfigManager.kt with SHA-256 integrity + version tracking):** bookmark, briefing, calclaw (AI calorie tracker), calculator, crypto-prices, define, github, joke, movie-tv, netwatch (network monitoring & security audit), news, notes, quote, reminders, research, summarize, timer, todo, translate, weather
**Workspace skills (agent-usable examples):** crypto-prices, device-status, dictionary, exchange-rates, github, location, movie-tv, phone-call, recipe, sms, solana-dapp, solana-wallet, speak
**Skill format:** YAML frontmatter (name, description, version, emoji, requires) — see `SKILL-FORMAT.md`
**Skill install** — `skill_install` tool to install skills from URL or Telegram file attachment, with diagnostics via `/skills` command
**Skill export/import** — Export individual skills as .md or bulk export user-added skills as ZIP; import from ZIP or .md file with path traversal protection, bundled skill overwrite prevention, size caps, and rollback on failure
**Skill images & labels** — Skills support `image` URL field (loaded via Coil), grouped into "Added" and "Default" sections, SHA-256 hash comparison detects modified defaults
**Auto-cleanup** — Empty skill directories removed automatically after file deletion

### Security
- **Prompt injection defense** — Content Trust Policy in system prompt, `<<<EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT>>>` boundary markers on all web_fetch/web_search results, 10-pattern suspicious content detection, Unicode homoglyph sanitization, zero-width space normalization
- **Skill file protection** — Writes/edits to `skills/` blocked when suspicious injection patterns detected in content
- **Tool confirmation gates** — `android_sms`, `android_call`, `solana_send`, `solana_swap`, `jupiter_trigger_create`, `jupiter_dca_create` require explicit user YES via Telegram before execution. 60s timeout auto-cancels. Rate limited (SMS/call 1 per 60s, Solana 1 per 15s, Jupiter 1 per 30s)

- **Secrets blocklist** — `config.json`, `config.yaml`, `seekerclaw.db` blocked from `read` tool (with symlink resolution) and `js_eval` fs access (proxied `fs`/`fs.promises` modules)
- **ALT-safe swap verification** — `verifySwapTransaction()` rejects instructions referencing programs via Address Lookup Tables (prevents drainer bypass)
- **js_eval sandbox** — blocked modules (child_process, vm, etc.), restricted fs (read/write/copy guards on sensitive files), shadowed `process`/`global`/`globalThis`
- API key redaction in logs
- Path traversal prevention (workspace sandboxing)

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **Node 18 only** — nodejs-mobile doesn't support Node 22+, so `node:sqlite` is unavailable (using SQL.js WASM instead)
- **No vector embeddings** — Semantic memory search not possible yet (keyword search only)
- **OEM battery killers** — Xiaomi MIUI, Samsung OneUI may aggressively kill the background service; Seeker's stock Android avoids this
- **No browser/screen/canvas skills** — Can't be ported from OpenClaw (requires desktop environment)
- **Ephemeral context** — Conversation history resets on Node.js restart (mitigated by session summaries)
- **Single channel** — Telegram only (no Discord, WhatsApp, etc.)
- **dApp Store live** — Available on Solana dApp Store (v1.4.3)
- **No light theme** — Dark only (DarkOps single theme)
