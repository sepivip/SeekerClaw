# NetWatch v2.3.2 — Testing Guide

## Test Prompts

### 1. Network Audit — Compact (default)
```
scan my network
```
**Expected:** Compact TL;DR output. Risk score + one-line summary, top risks (max 3), compact service status, 3 action commands. Fits on mobile without excessive scrolling. Zero `shell_exec`. Single message.

### 2. Network Audit — Full
```
full report
```
**Expected:** Full detailed output with all sections (risk score breakdown, all endpoints + latency, DNS results, port details, device info, recommendations). Triggered after a scan, or standalone.

### 3. Port Watch — Compact
```
check open ports
```
**Expected:** Compact one-line-per-port format. Ports grouped by status (expected/unusual/dangerous). Summary count. 3 action commands.

### 4. Connection Status — Compact
```
check my connection
```
**Expected:** Compact format showing fastest/slowest endpoints, DNS status, connection type. 3 action commands.

### 5. Deep Scan — Compact
```
deep scan .130
```
**Expected:** Compact 3-4 line summary: status, open ports, top risk, CTA. Within 8s budget.

### 6. Deep Scan Multi-Target — Compact
```
deep scan .130 and check .89 SSH
```
**Expected:** One compact line per target: IP — status — ports — risk. 3 action commands. Within 8s.

### 7. Full Report After Compact
```
scan my network
→ (gets compact output)
full report
→ (gets full detailed output)
```
**Expected:** First response is compact TL;DR. Second response is full detailed report with all technical sections.

### 8. Deep Scan — Timeout
```
deep scan 10.0.0.99
```
**Expected:** Compact report showing unreachable status. `⏱️ timed out` markers. Never hangs. 3 action commands.

### 9. DNS Probe Failure — Regression (BAT-241)
```
scan my network
```
**(Simulate: DNS resolver unavailable or dns.promises.resolve() throws)**
**Expected:** Scan completes with final report. DNS section shows `⚠️ DNS probe unavailable` or similar warning — NOT a crash. No `TypeError` or `UNCAUGHT` in console logs. Risk score still calculated (DNS failure adds +25 to risk). Report always delivered.

**What MUST NOT happen:**
- `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'write')` — this was the v2.3 crash
- Scan hangs with no output
- `UNCAUGHT` or `unhandledRejection` in Node.js console
- `js_eval FAIL` without a graceful report to the user

### 10. All Probes Fail — Resilience
```
scan my network
```
**(Simulate: no network connectivity — all probes timeout or error)**
**Expected:** Scan completes with high-risk report (76-100 CRITICAL). Each failed probe appears as warning. Report always delivered with 3 action commands. No crashes.

## Before/After Comparison

### BEFORE (v2.2) — UX Problems
- Default output is a wall of text (15+ lines)
- Every section always shown even if empty/healthy
- Technical detail mixed with actionable info
- User loses trust seeing too much output
- No way to get compact vs detailed view

### AFTER (v2.3) — Compact Default
- Default: TL;DR (3-4 lines) + top risks + compact services + 3 actions
- Fits cleanly on mobile without scrolling
- `full report` unlocks complete technical detail on demand
- Same risk logic, same probe data — better UX only
- Empty/healthy sections collapsed or omitted

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] DNS probe failure does not crash scan — appears as warning (BAT-241)
- [ ] No `TypeError` or `UNCAUGHT` errors in console during scan (BAT-241)
- [ ] Scan always returns final report even if all probes fail (BAT-241)
