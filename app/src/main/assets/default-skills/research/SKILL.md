# Web Research

## Instructions
When researching a topic:

2. For detailed info, use web_fetch on promising URLs
   - Prefer authoritative sources (Wikipedia, official sites, reputable news)
   - Avoid clickbait or low-quality sources

3. Synthesize information from multiple sources
   - Cross-reference facts when possible
   - Note if sources conflict

4. Format findings clearly:
   - Lead with the key answer
   - Add supporting details
   - Cite sources when relevant

5. Save important findings to memory if the user might need them later
